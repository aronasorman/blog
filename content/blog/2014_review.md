2014 has been another great year for me, mostly filled with new
experiences as I get inducted into the "adult" world, as well as
seeing new places I've never been to before.

## Moments

### Snow! (January)

I saw snow. That's right: 21 years here on Earth and I only touched
snow for the first time last January.

### Work authorization (February)

Thanks to my relatively long name, I've been unemployed since April of
last year due to a conflict between my passport's name and the one in
my immigration documents. So Social Security has refused to issue an
SSN for me 'til I had my name corrected. And guess how long
Immigration took to correct my name? 9 months. I guess they had to
give birth to the person responsible for changing my documents first.

In the meantime I managed to land an internship, and eventually a dev
contract with the [FLE](https://learningequality.org/).

### Hired! (March)



### Trip back to the Philippines (July)

One big milestone for me ever since I migrated to the U.S. was my
first trip back to my home country. It has always occupied my mind,
being stuck at home, with what normally should be a Friday night
hangout with friends turning into a lonely evening watching another
American Football rerun (although Footbal *is* awesome).  At first I
kept thinking that I'll go back the moment I get my immigration status
is sorted out. But as the date for that gets pushed farther and
farther (see work authorization) so did my long-awaited trip. After
almost a year pushing back the trip it was a big relief to finally
purchase the plane ticket, and inform my friends of the date.


And let me tell you, it was awesome, finally coming back after more
than a year away from home. I guess I'm too old to fully integrate
"America" into my identity, and although I've gotten comfortable with
my how relatively *empty* and easy-going Downtown San Diego is, I'll
be lying if I say I don't miss the fast pace and slow traffic of EDSA.

Aaaand of course, what better way to induct myself back into Manila's
hustle and bustle than the craziest line I've ever seen in the MRT:

That was the second floor; there's a staircase at the end that leads,
to the first floor, where the trains actually are.

Although now that I took the trip back as part of the workforce, I'm
now able to affort *things* that a college student can't, such as eat
at relatively pricey (but good!) restaurants in Makati:

Mmmm, the venerable *sisig*. And *adobong kangkong*. Can't find that
anywhere else!

I also took a trip to Vigan, and its famous *Kalye Crisologo*:

Although honestly, that is only one street. The rest are just your
regular Province-style streets. The sights were a bit disappointing, IMO.
