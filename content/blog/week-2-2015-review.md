# W2 2015 review

## Work events

- Tons of new interns. 17 by the last count. I'm extremely skeptical
  of how they're gonna be handled, but this should be a learning
  experience both for them and us as well.
- I've realized that a big factor of my burnout during December was
  how little programming I actually accomplished each day. This
  stemmed from the frequent interruptions I got when I programmed. So
  we've made a commitment to try and group all the "meetings" into
  MWF, and leave TTh for "productive work" such as programming. See
  the [maker's schedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html).


## Learnings

- I've been working on the
  [Matasano Crypto Challenge](http://cryptopals.com/). I'm in set 1
  challenge 6. Part of the challenge was to implement the Hamming
  Distance for two strings, and to implement that I had to learn how
  to count the "on" bits in a byte. I realized then that I had very
  little bit-flipping knowledge, so I looked up how to count bits, and
  encountered
  [Brian Kernighan's bit-counting algorithm](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12380478/bits-counting-algorithm-brian-kernighan-in-an-integer-time-complexity).

- It was the first time I used Git's [reflog]() feature in the
  wild. Glad to have finally used it by helping a co-worker restore
  their tree to a state before a fast-forward.
