# W3 2015 review

# General Events

- I finally achieved my short-term goal of biking all the way from
  home to work. It's been my fear ever since I've taken a two-month
  trip to the Philippines that I "haven't got it in me" anymore, so
  it's nice to know that I'm strong enough again to take that 16 mile
  long bike ride.

## Learnings

- Still learning FreeBSD on my spare time. FreeBSD has some simple IDS
  tools builtin to it. One of the builtin tools is called [mtree](),
  a file integrity checker. (Expand on mtree)
