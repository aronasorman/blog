# General Events
- On Wednesday, My macbook air died, and wouldn't turn on. I silently
  panicked at work for the entire morning, as the day before I've
  (once again) botched my work dev machine, so I was hoping to rely on
  my mac for awhile. With my Mac gone I wouldn't be able to do any
  work.

  So after the All-Hands Meeting today I biked to the nearest Apple
  Store, and set an appointment with a "Genius" (I was skeptical of
  this label). Fortunately he was able to fix this by resetting the
  battery system's controller by pressing the Option+Shift+Power
  key. The day was saved. Thanks "Genius"! (I'm still slightly
  skeptical of such a label).
