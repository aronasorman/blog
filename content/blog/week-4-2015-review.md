# General Events
- On Wednesday, My macbook air died, and wouldn't turn on. I silently
  panicked at work for the entire morning, as the day before I've
  (once again) botched my work dev machine, so I was hoping to rely on
  my mac for awhile. With my Mac gone I wouldn't be able to do any
  work.

  So after the All-Hands Meeting today I biked to the nearest Apple
  Store, and set an appointment with a "Genius" (I was skeptical of
  this label). Fortunately he was able to fix this by resetting the
  battery system's controller by pressing the Option+Shift+Power
  key. The day was saved. Thanks "Genius"! (I'm still slightly
  skeptical of such a label).


- I've been trying to get into making some personal music by following
  [Tidal's getting started page](http://tidal.lurk.org/getting_started.html). At
  first I installed Tidal and all of its dependencies on my Linux VM,
  but then when I try playing a sound it has this weird distorted and
  stuttered sound coming out, no matter what audio file I play. I've
  tried changing the QJackCtl settings as well as playing around with
  the midi rate on OS X, but alas the stuttering sound never
  vanished. I then tried installing it on OS X itself. It works
  perfectly in there.

  Music, here I come! (In a very slow pace)
