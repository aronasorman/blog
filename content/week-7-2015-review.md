# General Events
- I got inspired by this
  [blog post](http://calnewport.com/blog/2013/12/21/deep-habits-the-importance-of-planning-every-minute-of-your-work-day/)
  to try and be more productive (trying to be more "productive" has
  been a priority in my mind for quite some time).

  I'm particularly interested by the concept of time-blocking -- like
  literally, planning in advance how your day will go. On a minute by
  minute basis.

  It's an intriguing idea, and one I can see the benefit of. One
  problem I've been encountering each day at work was that there were
  so many things to do that you *just don't know where to start*. That
  often leads to me jumping around different tasks depending on what
  seems most urgent as determined by my current state of mind. This
  means I'm really flexible at work (anyone can just ping me to talk
  about something), but it means that I usually am not able to keep my
  deadlines for certain tasks. By creating a plan before you start
  your day, I can hopefully set aside time for tasks I know *are*
  important, and not just what's the hot topic of the minute.

  So yeah, I'm going to try it out. This weekend I'll be scoping out
  the best way to use this with org-mode, and see what I can come up
  with.

# Work Events
- I'll be heading out to India on Monday, Feb. 16! It's quite surreal
  honestly, as I'll be encountering yet another foreign culture. And
  though it's supposed to be a "casual business" visit, I'm sure it'll
  feel like a vacation either way :) (hopefully...)
