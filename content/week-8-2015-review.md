# General Events
- India! Man what an amazing place. I never imagined a place with
  crazier traffic than Manila. Well, Mumbai-Pune takes the cake. I can
  only describe the style of driving in here as "balls of
  steel"-driven driving. Why I say that:

  In some intersections, cab drivers literally go through it without
  stopping, leaving other cars to stop just *inches* of the cab. The
  cab got through first because he had balls of steel.

  In another instance, we rode a cab heading back to the office. There
  was this long line of motorcycles in front of us (Indians seem to
  love motorcycles). Since they drove so slowly, our cab driver
  decided to drive in the other side of the road, *where there was a
  truck* 200 meters away. We were literally meeting each other
  eye-to-eye, and it seems like it's a contest on who will give in
  first to drive in the shoulder. Once again, the truck gives in and
  makes way for our cab. Balls of steel right there.

- The Maharashtra state's cuisine (which includes Mumbai and Pune), is
  very spicy. Taob ang bicol. I've ordered a lot of food here where
  they claim to not be spicy, yet are *super hot* by my standards. I
  dunno, are Indian tongues numb after so many years of eating food
  this spicy? Like literally, even their waffle syrup has a bit of
  heat in it. I shudder to think what their food explicitly marked as
  spicy tastes like.

  Apart from the spiciness, I really dig Indian food. The rice dishes
  have this certain aroma that sets it apart from any other type of
  dish out there. Like dumping some sort of perfume in the rice, the
  food smells so good I can smell it while chewing it. There are also
  dishes (supposedly northern in origin) that are very milky
  and involve a lot of cheese. Those, too, were excellent dishes.
